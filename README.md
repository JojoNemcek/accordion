# Flex-Card Time-Based Accordion for Aetter Radio

## Technologies Used
**HTML5:** Structure of the accordion and content layout.<br>
**CSS3:** Styling with flexbox for responsiveness, media       queries for adaptability, and custom animations.<br>
**JavaScript:** Logic for time-based activation and manual toggling of cards.

<br>

## How It Works
**Time-Based Logic:** JavaScript calculates the current time and compares it to the predefined intervals in the schedule array.<br>
**Dynamic Activation:** The corresponding card for the current time is marked as active, dynamically adjusting the layout.
User Interaction: Users can manually toggle cards by clicking on them. Only one card can be active at a time.<br>
**Responsive Adjustments:** Styles adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.
